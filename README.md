# DummyText (Chrome Extension)

Simple, quick and unobtrusive dummy text generator for web designers and developers. This extension installs a small icon in your browser allowing you quick access to paragraphs of dummy text (Lorem ipsum style) at the click of a button.

The number of paragraphs, words per paragraph and whether or not to wrap paragraphs in paragraph tags can be changed easily. Once happy with your selection, simply click the Copy button and the text is sent straight to your clipboard ready for pasting!
